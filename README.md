This program implements Priority Queue using Minimum Heap and Linked List (ascending order). 
In the implemented Priority Queue, the smallest element has the highest priority. Therefore, the delete method removes the smallest element in the min heap or linked list.
The test class generates 10,000 random integers and then adds them to Linked List and Min Heap using their respective insert methods. Insertion times are compared to compare performance.
